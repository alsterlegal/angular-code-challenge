# star-wars-code-challenge

You will need to create a Web App containing information related to the Star Wars universe.
The app should have at least three different routes.

- `/` where you should list all the films, with essential information for each one (title, release date, director).
    - Each title should have a link redirecting to the film route on the same app

- `/film/<id>` for each movie.
    - On this page, the whole movie information should be listed, including the complete list of characters, where each character should have a link, redirecting to the character route on the same app

- `/character/<id>` for each character.
    - On this page, only display the basic information for each character (name, height, mass, date of birth, etc.)

There isn't a design; feel free to be creative ðŸ™‚

_Extra points for having pictures of the films and the main characters on each description._
